## Description

This project is a single-page application that provides a comprehensive overview of the cryptocurrency market.

The dashboard features a responsive and interactive interface with detailed charting capabilities.

## Features

*   **Real-time Data:** Fetches and displays up-to-the-minute cryptocurrency prices and market data.
*   **Multiple Cryptocurrencies:** Supports a configurable list of cryptocurrencies.
*   **Global Market Overview:** Shows global market capitalization, trading volume, and Bitcoin dominance.
*   **Fear & Greed Index:** Displays the current Fear & Greed Index to gauge market sentiment.
*   **Trading Recommendations:** Integrates with a custom API to provide buy/sell/hold recommendations.
*   **Interactive Charts:** Uses Lightweight Charts to display candlestick and volume data, with support for different timeframes.
*   **Ruler Tool:** A tool to measure price changes and time duration directly on the chart. After measuring, it displays a draggable info box with detailed results, which can be closed to deactivate the tool.
*   **Customizable Settings:** Allows users to configure the model, timeframe, and other parameters.
*   **Responsive Design:** The interface is designed to work on different screen sizes.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you need a web server to serve the `index.html`, `script.js`, and `styles.css` files. You can use any simple web server, such as Python's `http.server` or the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.

1.  Clone this repository or download the files.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser through a web server.

## Usage

The dashboard is divided into two main views: the main dashboard and the detailed crypto view.

*   **Dashboard View:** This is the main view, which displays a list of cryptocurrencies in either a card or list format. It also shows the global market data and the Fear & Greed Index.
*   **Crypto Detail View:** Clicking on a cryptocurrency in the dashboard will take you to the detail view. This view shows a detailed chart for the selected cryptocurrency, along with its current price, volume, and trading recommendations.
